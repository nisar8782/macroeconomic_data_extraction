# Macroeconomic data extraction and modelling

The model developed in Python in conjunction with another professional allows any data to be extracted from the official Eurostat site, returning to the user a table that has already been processed and modeled. This need is given by the fact that the API provided by the site does not allow to extract data from custom tables, but only from the default ones. In addition, a further motivation for developing the model was the need to speed up the data extraction and preprocessing steps. With the developed code, the user only needs to enter the codes of the tables of interest into a list and start execution.
