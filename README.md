# Macroeconomic data scraping and modelling

The need to develop this code arose from the need to obtain data from custom tables based on needs from the Eurostat website. For example, get the data that shows the change from the previous year, rather than the entire data of the current year.

This is not possible through the use of the API offered by Eurostat. Therefore, we have developed a code to meet the needs. You can then customize the table according to your preferences from the Eurostat site and simply use the generated code to read the data.

In addition, data modelling has been integrated in order to integrate all variables into a single table.

The code has been hidden for the moment.
